Quiz Master

Quiz Master is a trivia game developed with Unity. Players answer different questions, and their score increases based on correct answers.

✨ Features

* Multiple-choice quiz system

* Score tracking based on correct/incorrect answers

* Simple and clean UI

* Easily add and edit questions

  * This is made possible by Unity’s [CreateAssetMenu] attribute.

  * With [CreateAssetMenu(menuName ="Quiz Question", fileName ="New Question")], a new option called “Quiz Question” is added to the Unity Editor’s Create menu.

  * This allows developers to quickly create new question assets as ScriptableObjects without writing additional code—just select Create → Quiz Question and fill in the details.

** A great template to build your own quiz game → Everything is set up, so you can focus on adding and customizing your own questions.**
